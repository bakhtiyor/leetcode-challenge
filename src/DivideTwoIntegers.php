/**
 * Divide Two Integers
 *
 * Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division, and mod
 * operator. The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example,
 * 8.345 would be truncated to 8, and -2.7335 would be truncated to -2. Return the quotient after dividing dividend by
 * divisor. Note: Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed
 * integer range: [âˆ’231, 231 âˆ’ 1]. For this problem, if the quotient is strictly greater than 231 - 1, then
 * return 231 - 1, and if the quotient is strictly less than -231, then return -231.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: 10/3 = 3.33333.. which is truncated to 3.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: dividend = 7, divisor = -3
 * Output: -2
 * Explanation: 7/-3 = -2.33333.. which is truncated to -2.

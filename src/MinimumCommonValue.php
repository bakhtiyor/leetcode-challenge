/**
 * Minimum Common Value
 *
 * Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, return the minimum integer common to both
 * arrays. If there is no common integer amongst nums1 and nums2, return -1. Note that an integer is said to be common
 * to nums1 and nums2 if both arrays have at least one occurrence of that integer.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums1 = [1,2,3], nums2 = [2,4]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The smallest element common to both arrays is 2, so we return 2.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,6], nums2 = [2,3,4,5]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: There are two common elements in the array 2 and 3 out of which 2 is the smallest, so 2 is returned.

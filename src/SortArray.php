/**
 * Sort an Array
 *
 * Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order and return it. You must solve the problem without
 * using any built-in functions in O(nlog(n)) time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [5,2,3,1]
 * Output: [1,2,3,5]
 * Explanation: After sorting the array, the positions of some numbers are not changed (for example, 2 and 3), while the
 * positions of other numbers are changed (for example, 1 and 5).
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [5,1,1,2,0,0]
 * Output: [0,0,1,1,2,5]
 * Explanation: Note that the values of nums are not necessary unique.
